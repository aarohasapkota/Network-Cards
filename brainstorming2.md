    Challenges would be creating flashcards and adding functionalities that allows user to make decks for themselves and export it to share with others.

## **Remind Me**

    **Remind Me** is an alarm clock that reminds you things you have to do. Anytime you remember something you have to do by a deadline or remind you to call someone, use remind me. We will send alarms on your phone to remind you.

    This app is for someone that has a busy schedule and has habbit of forgetting things. Next time, you have to remind yourself to make a phone call or text, use Remind Me.

    I personally, have an issue of forgetting things like sending or replying to email or submit my assignment which is not due 11:59pm. I use Apple Alarm to contantly remind me of such things. Remind Me will do it with enhanced features.
* **Challenges**
    The challenge would be mostly about sending out alarms and with different volumes and vibration. Another major issue would be in the "Use with Siri" optional functionality.
